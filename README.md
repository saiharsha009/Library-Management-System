# Library Management System

## **Programming Language:** Python (3.11)

## **Project Setup and Execution**
To run the project, follow these steps:

### **1. Download and Navigate to Project Directory**
- Download the project ZIP file.
- Extract it and navigate to the project folder in the command prompt.

### **2. Install Required Libraries**
Before running the project, install all the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Running the Backend**
The backend runs on Flask and should be executed in a virtual environment.

#### **Step 3.1: Activate Virtual Environment**
Open **Command Prompt 1**, navigate to the project directory, and activate the virtual environment:
```sh
.\Scripts\activate.bat
```

#### **Step 3.2: Run Flask Application**
Once inside the virtual environment, start the Flask backend by running:
```sh
flask --app app run
```
This will start the backend server.

### **4. Running the Frontend**
The frontend is built using **Streamlit** and should be executed in a separate command prompt.

#### **Step 4.1: Activate Virtual Environment**
Open **Command Prompt 2**, navigate to the project directory, and activate the virtual environment:
```sh
.\Scripts\activate.bat
```

#### **Step 4.2: Start the Streamlit App**
Once inside the virtual environment, start the frontend using Streamlit:
```sh
streamlit run login.py --client.showSidebarNavigation=False
```
